==============================================================
Increase Locust's performance with a faster HTTP client
==============================================================

Locust's default HTTP client uses `python-requests <http://www.python-requests.org/>`_. 
The reason for this is that requests is a very well-maintained python package, that 
provides a really nice API, that many python developers are familiar with. Therefore, 
in many cases, we recommend that you use the default :py:class:`HttpUser <locust.HttpUser>`
which uses requests. However, if you're planning to run really large scale tests, 
Locust comes with an alternative HTTP client, 
:py:class:`FastHttpUser <locust.contrib.fasthttp.FastHttpUser>` which
uses `geventhttpclient <https://github.com/gwik/geventhttpclient/>`_ instead of requests.
This client is significantly faster, and we've seen 5x-6x performance increases for making 
HTTP-requests. This does not necessarily mean that the number of users one can simulate 
per CPU core will automatically increase 5x-6x, since it also depends on what else 
the load testing script does. However, if your locust scripts are spending most of their 
CPU time in making HTTP-requests, you are likely to see significant performance gains.


How to use FastHttpUser
===========================

Subclass FastHttpUser instead of HttpUser::

    from locust import task, between
    from locust.contrib.fasthttp import FastHttpUser
    
    class MyUser(FastHttpUser):
        wait_time = between(2, 5)
        
        @task
        def index(self):
            response = self.client.get("/")


.. note::

    Because FastHttpUser uses a different client implementation with a slightly different API,
    it may not always work as a drop-in replacement for HttpUser.
